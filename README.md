image repository


Run image_repository.py to start.

Project consists of a command line interface where users can buy/sell images with discounts if applicable and search for images by either name or defining characteristics
of the images. Upon starting the program, the command line will show all the available options. There is also a simple GUI for viewing the images with their respective names
and prices. Enjoy!
